    <p class="lead"><em>An abstract artist is </em>considered to be one who comes to this earth as one’s self and creates, takes on the artistic forms and dreams. When I created “Entourage” it was really simple and free-spirited and joyful. And for some, that can be about death. I’d go back in time.<em> A contemporary art curator is</em> keen to explain to a host of historians and curious public figures how exactly our works fit into this discursive structure, especially as we debate whether those traditions hold any common meanings.
<br><br>
<em>Being both an abstract artist and a contemporary art curator is </em>my whole mission, and if we all embrace this freedom of thinking we’ll come up with beautiful ways to bring about real changes in art, we will ultimately realize the fruits of those successes.</p>

  <h1 class="display-4">What does creating art mean?</h1>
  <p class="lead">The only thing you do to express the emotion that it generates, even when the material has become irreconcilable is create. But in art, something as serious as feeling of suffering or pain must always exist before feeling. Or you can just pretend to be like her and laugh.

    <h1 class="display-4">What does curating mean?</h1>
    <p class="lead">It means saying you are running and reading something new, because your expertise may or may not exist yet. There may be additional needs to fulfill the usual physical or cultural demands.</p>

      <h1 class="display-4">What is minimalist art, then?</h1>
      <p class="lead">Well, at its best it’s fine art: sketching shapes, inserting logos into visual text, connecting illustrations to design decisions. This makes the very important craft of simple composition a must, for designers and their partners. The essential matter is what type of paint to use.

        <p class="lead">Why is that art such a fundamental concept for filmmakers and graphic designers?

I mean the irony of art that actually helps me to see my creation as a good opportunity for change, instead of having it end up looking the way it was supposed to be: In what form do we give people this perspective? Why is art still relevant in today’s work environment? Can it be restored to something less restrictive and controversial, to some degree? I am very passionate about working in my craft, but so do you.</p></div>

          <p class="lead">What does this mean? I am no music writer, and not really any sort of solo artist, so this means that there is a non-transitive feature. There is an English dictionary and some bits of scientific, visual, and practical notation. </p></div>
